<h1>REPRESENTING THE BORDER WITH NEW VISUALIZATION TECHNOLOGIES</h1>

<div id="3-1" class="section">
    <h4>An Introduction to Digital Geovisualization</h4>
    
    <p>In <i>Rethinking The Power of Maps</i>, Denis draws on Saussurian semiotics, to argue that mapping is a semiotic practice of meaning-making. In this sense, the map is coded with a wide range of signifiers and meanings. At the heart of this complex array of signifiers is "the border". In early modern cartography, the border often signified the division of two parcels of state or private property, and it's signifier was a well-defined ink line on parchment. In contemporary cartographies this original <i>signified</i> concept of "the border" is being challenged and rediscovered as more complex and often contradictory. This new, more complex meaning demands a new, more complex method of representation- a new "signifier."</p><p>In parallel with the rise of more fluid mapping practices has been the rise of digital technologies, which provide opportunities to embed complex and dynamic qualities into representations of space. In 2005, the International Cartographic Association (ICA) established a Commission on Geovisualization, to focus on "use of interactive maps and cartographic techniques to support visual analysis of complex, voluminous and heterogeneous information," (ICA 2014). "Geovisualization" is simply a term used for the visualization of geospatial data and information. In particular, the ICA is concerned with the <i>display</i> of the "complex structure" of spatial data- which includes space, time, and thematic attributes- as well as the <i>exploration</i> of the relationships between these complex components. The ICA believes that geovisualization is important for knowledge building and theory generation as well as decision support, information communication, education, and learning. </p><p>The ICA is concerned with all realms of geographic study, but I believe that border studies can especially benefit from exploration and analysis through geovisualization. Drawing from this ICA's priorities of representing and exploring the complex spatial and temporal elements of geographic data, this chapter focuses on some emerging digital visualization practices that help reframe our understanding of "the border." Specifically, this chapter addresses the following questions: How can digital technologies surpass the static map's ability to display temporally and spatially complex borders? How can digital technologies surpass the static map's ability to explore relationships between the spatial and temporal components of borders? This chapter also problematizes the ICA's assumption that the spatial component of geographic data is necessarily Cartesian, and it will explore ways to visualize non-Cartesian understandings of "the border." I address each question with an example of my own implementation of a digital technology, followed by a critical analysis of what each technique offers and lacks. </p>

    <h4>Mapping Temporally Dynamic Borders</h4>
    
    <p>Borders are dynamic, evolving, impermanent, and disputed. But maps, like history, tend to be written by the victors, further ensuring that the border narrative we often read appears static. The historical evolution of borders is frequently ignored or forgotten in our representations of them, because, as Andrienko, et al. (2010) point out, "the methods used in static maps are limited to small amounts of data and few time units." But digital maps, unlike paper maps, have the advantage that they can convey the dynamic history of borders using interactivity and animation. </p>

    <p>Figure 3-1 is an example I created to show the evolution of the border between the United States and Mexico using map animation. It slides from frame to frame automatically, much like the .gif animations that are popular around the social Internet, to provide a visual timeline of the border. At the moment, the animated map stands alone, but I can conceive it as an informative basemap layered under any variety of demographic or economic data. Doing so might help blur the line between "us" and "them" and challenge national stereotypes by recognizing historical overlap.</p><p>While animated maps make the <i>presence of change</i> quite clear, research suggests that they may not actually help the user grasp the <i>individual changes</i> that are occurring (Slocum et al., 2004). Tests conducted by the Commission on Geovisualization revealed that users tested on static map displays seemed more focused on 'states' and 'spatial patterns' rather than <i>events</i> and temporal <i>processes</i>,"(Andrienko et al., 2010). Tufte (1997) recommends the implementation of "small multiples"-i.e. multiple static frames side by side- to communicate changes to a user. With this in mind, I created a new version of the visualization (Figure 3-2). This updated visualization relies on a manual slider so that users can click through the visualization at her/his own pace. Like the animated version, this manual slider could be adopted as basemap for other spatial information, but it would require more effort and interest on the part of the user. </p>

    <h4>Mapping Spatially Concurrent Borders</h4>
    
    <p>Mapping the history of a border forces us to recognize that multiple "borders" can and have existed in a single space at different moments in time. Perhaps a greater challenge is mapping multiple, interrelated borders in a single space at the same moment in time. Static maps are forced by their nature to show everything at once or not show it at all, thus the relationship between concentric and overlapping geographies can easily be overlook or confused on a crowded static map. On static maps, conflicting and intersecting borders are often omitted or differentiated from one another by line width or color.</p><p>Interactive digital maps, however, allow us to display more and more complex geographies. One particularly complex border geography is that of the overlapping jurisdications that make up the various political units of the British Isles. Using the digital tools at my disposal, I attempted to visualize the multiple and interrelated geographies that make up (and are made up by) the United Kingdom (Figure 3-3). This task, of course, assumes that borders <i>do</i> concretely exist and they <i>can</i> be drawn with relative accuracy, thus I was required to adopt this assumption, at least temporarily.</p>

    </div>
    
    <p>As a potential solution to this problem, I built an interactive digital slider. As a user clicks through the slider, s/he is consecutively exposed to cartographies of related geobodies such as the United Kingdom, the British Isles, Great Britain, and England. The user can interact with each slide by hovering over maps and text to reveal more information or additional images for comparison. Unlike a static map, the slider allows users to view each geobody individually, consecutively, and concurrently. This establishes an understanding of each geobody as a separate entity as well as establish an understanding of its relationship to the other sovereign bodies in question. The goal is to show the user how multiple geobodies (each with different sovereignty claims) can and do exist in the same place. </p><p>This visualization, like the historical border visualization, assumes that we know enough about what and where a border is to draw it on a map. This assumption, of course, is a particular border perspective in itself. But I believe that the interactive slider visualization method can be used to represent multiple different perspectives, not just multiple borders derived from the same perspective. </p>

    <h4>Exploring and Creating New Border Landscapes</h4>
    
    <p>Interactive digital maps allow cartographers to communicate more, and more complex, stories than static maps, but ultimately the map (and thus the user of the map) is subject to the same constraints. Digital technology, however, provides an opportunity for users to tailor maps to their own values and perspectives. As the ICA points out, the exploration of data is an important objective of geovisualization (ICA 2014).</p>

    <p>My project "UNC Solar Map" (Figure 3-4) is an example of a user-customizable map. The map, created with the purpose of helping decision-makers identify feasible sites for PV solar panel installation, lets users customize the cost and budget details that factor into the suitability calculation. Suitable solar panel installation sites then appear and disappear on the map based on the user's custom feasibility parameters. While the UNC Solar Map project itself is not directly related to borders, the project's customizable technology could be adopted in a new border project. This project would allow users to define their own "border requirements" to create their own political maps. Users could draw and dissolve conventionally accepted international political borders based on custom criteria such as flow quantities of capital or people, or political or economic influence. </p><p>This project does not entirely circumvent the perspective of the cartographer, as the parameter options s/he provides could never encompass the every desire of every user. Additionally, this project would be dependent on the conventional cartography that it would be built upon. Finally, while the project recognizes that what constitutes a border can vary by perspective, it provides no room for non-linear, non-Cartesian understandings of the border.</p><p>Open sourced mapping platforms such as Open Street Maps take the 'customizable map' one step further by letting users not just customize, but actually create their own maps. Open Street Maps, for example, shifts power to the people by letting them define and describe their own surroundings instead of letting The State dictate what is/isn't, exists/doesn't exist. Yet even crowd sourced maps like Open Street Maps cannot evade the influence of Western state cartography. In fact, assuming that the majority of the users have grown up saturated with Western cartographic conventions, it is likely that these conventions will simply be replicated in users' own cartographies. </p>

    <h4>Mapping the Performed Border</h4>
    
    <p>On their website, the ICA Commission on Geovisualization proclaims that "the visualization of spatial data requires the use of maps or 3D displays where at least two display dimensions are utilized to represent the physical space." But this statement reveals the critical assumption that the spatial attributes of geographic data necessarily exist within a Cartesian coordinate system. This assumption is unsurprising because GIS conventionally conceptualizes space as 'absolute', Euclidean, or Cartesian space wherein objects are clearly defined and exist at precise locations and scales. (Pavlovskaya, 2009:25). Yet while it is unsurprising, this assumption is limiting. In critical geography, understanding social processes requires an understanding of 'relational' space (Harvey, 2006; Massey, 1985), because aspects like experience, power, and certain properties of place lack Euclidean measurements. According to Marianna Pavlovskaya, Understanding these aspects of space requires qualitative modes of explanation prominent in Marxian, feminist, post-structural, and postcolonial approaches," (25).</p><p>Artists Susan Page and Pedro Lash, recognizing the importance of relational space and human experience, take a performative approach to understanding the border. Both artists use smaller-scale and personalized methods of collecting and documenting the lived experiences of "the border" which make up "the border" itself. With this in mind, I asked whether it might be possible to scale-up this performative border mapping by integrating data from social media. The rise and spread of social media allows us to collect massive amounts of similar data, but in digital form. Using social media data gathered through Twitter and Instagram, I built a digital project to explore the US-Mexico border through people's publicly and digitally documented experiences (Figures 3-5 and 3-6). </p>

    <p>Though the Twin Cities project aims to blur a clearly-defined political border using social data, it is limited by its dependence on a conventional political map to navigate the data. Even the satellite image of the region, offered as an alternative to the graphical maps that draw borders as natural and obvious landmarks, has its own perspective and bias. Satellite images, like all photographs, are taken from an allocentric point of view. As McKinnon (2011) points out in her essay on recent cartographic practices in the social sciences, this is linked to Haraway's critique of "the god-trick of seeing everything from nowhere," (Haraway, 1988: 678). Furthermore, the project differentiates the two "sides" of each twin city by the location of the political border, rather than letting the social data determine if/where the border exists. </p><p>By incorporating qualitative, ethnographic data into a Cartesian display, the Twin Cities project takes a "mixed method" approach common in the field of critical human cartography. According to Pavolvskaya, mixing methods makes relational spaces of experience and power visible, and thus "theoretically and politically" significant (28). It also reveals inconsistences in partial knowledges and opens up research opportunities about "social power configurations," (29). The mixed method approach enjoys some success by bringing much-needed qualitative consideration to the overwhelming quantitative field of GIS, but it does very little to challenge and change the Cartesian notions of space which have been shaped by Cartography for centuries. Rather, when relational geographies are mapped with Cartesian coordinates, Euclidean distances dominate our visual interpretations of the phenomenon and we are forced to (re)think of relations in Cartesian terms.</p>

    <h4>Mapping Non-Cartesian Borders</h4>
    
    <p>I was first introduced to the rapidly changing role of technology in shaping how we understand Geography through the Digital Humanities, a discipline that borrows methods from the humanities to analyze digital and digitized materials using computing tools. My specific experience with Digital Humanities involved digitizing, coding, and archiving oral histories about the intersection of religion and place. The digital component of the project made the oral histories easier to search, sort, and compare, and it also allowed us to plot the oral histories using a "mixed method" approach. </p><p>While our attempts to visualize the relationships between religion and space within and across the oral histories provided an extra dimension of analysis, it also posed many challenges. First, as the ICA explains, when two dimensions are utilized to represent physical space, this "restricts the possibilities for the representation of the temporal and thematic components of the data," (ICA 2014). Secondly, and most importantly, the resulting mixed method visualization did very little to enhance the data. The map we produced illustrated where in <i>Cartesian</i> space each recorded event occurred, but drawing on feminist and performative theories of space, the geolocation of each event turned out to be far less important than the relational spaces wherein they occurred. Additionally, our visualization suffered from the same dominance of Euclidean relationships that most all mixed method maps suffer from. With a budding interest in information visualization, I was inspired to take on the challenge of visualizing the project's non-Cartesian geographies.</p><p>My endeavor resulted in a responsive network map that aimed to synthesize the prevalence of each space within the oral histories as well as the relative relations between each space (Figure 3-7). Built using Google Fusion Tables- a free technology available to anyone with a Google account- the network map was an easy feat to accomplish and one replicable by most any interested person. </p>

    </div>
    
    <p>Mapping oral histories about religion might seem unrelated to the present question of borders, but it is not. Borders, like people's experiences with religion, are not necessarily <i>primarily</i> Cartesian. In other words, borders aren't as solid as we once thought they were. The ability to organize information and data in new configurations- unbounded by Cartesian conventions- opens up opportunities to find new patterns. Additionally, unlike Cartesian maps, non-Cartesian maps never pretend to be mirror representations of the real physical world. Non-Cartesian maps can be a way of breaking the habit of assuming that borders exist on the ground exactly the way they exist on paper.</p><p>Of course, we are socially conditioned to expect maps to look a certain way (i.e. Cartesian), thus it might be difficult for many people to accept a non-Cartesian representation of a border as an "accurate" representation. Non-Cartesian maps might rather be accepted as supplements to, but not replacements for, Cartesian representations. Non-Cartesian maps still require us to categorize and theoretically bound phenomenon and ideas, even if they do not require us to bound them spatially. Thus they do not entirely free our representations of borders from and subjective decisions, assumptions, and exclusions. </p>

    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    
    <p>Technology is not required to visualize non-Cartesian representations of space. In fact, a static network map of actors and institutions might be much more informative of a border regime than a complex, interactive Cartesian cartography. But technology allows us to communicate more, and more complex data more simply, and non-Cartesian data is no exception to this. The digital inclusion of multi-media evidence of experience and performance can help us generate new understandings of "the border," and technology can help us collect large amounts of this evidence using social media. Technology also makes the exploration of information more widely available to interested persons. Democratizing geospatial data and analysis is not only right, but it is important because we, the people, are ultimately the ones both creating and being impacted by the "geo-spaces" in question. </p>
