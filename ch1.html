<h1>CARTOGRAPHY AND THE CREATION OF "THE BORDER"</h1>

<div id="1-1" class="section">
    <h4>What is "The Border"?</h4>
    
    <p>In 1976, Raymond Williams wrote "Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society" in order to describe and discuss words which, he says, "are significant, binding words in certain activities and their interpretation" and "significant, indicative words in certain forms of thought." The word "border" was excluded from his work, but modern geography scholars, arguing that this term now demands a critically deconstructive analysis just as much as William's keywords, have remedied this in a new piece of work titled "New Keywords: Migration and Borders," (Casas-Cortes, et al. 2014). According to the authors, "the discursive currency of these terms, and much of what has come to be commonplace in popular understandings about borders and migration, is the product of a rather short (global) history," (1-2).</p>
    <p>Consider the definition below from the Oxford English Dictionary:</p>
    <div style="text-align: center"><p><b>border</b>/ <i>noun</i> <b>1</b>. a line separating two political or geographical areas, especially countries. "the German <b>border with</b> Denmark" <b>2</b>. the edge or boundary of something, or the part near it. "the northern border of their distribution area" </p></div>
    <p>This definition seems to capture the popular understanding about borders, but it is far from adequate. As Raymond Williams explains in the beginning of "Keywords", "When we come to say 'we just don't speak the same language' we mean [...] that we have different immediate values or different kinds of valuation, or that we are aware, often intangibly, of different formations and distributions of energy and interest," (11). In other words, "particular terms and phrases acquire quite discrepant and even contrary meanings over time and across space, such that the same words - and the conceptual categories that they index - can be so variously deployed, from one idiomatic usage to the next, as to appear to no longer refer to the same things,"(Casas-Cortes, et al. 2014: 2). The O.E.D. definition tells us that a border is "a line separating two political or geographical areas," but what is a "geographical area" except a piece of the earth demarcated by a border? This definition tells us that a border is the edge of <i>something</i>. But <i>what</i> thing? </p>

    <h4>Sovereignty: Not as Simple As You Think</h4>
    
    <p>Modern sovereignty-related research generally relies on the basic assumption that the world's territory exists in "non-overlapping, juridical autonomous spaces" (Murphy, 2005: 281) and that the only question is how authority in those spaces is exercised (R. Jones, 2009: 376). But, as Reece Jones reminds us, "the traditional definition of sovereignty as the unambiguous connection between a single sovereign entity and a clearly defined territory is, of course, increasingly contested," (376).</p>

    <p>For one, territory is not always so "clearly defined," as Figure 1-1 illustrates. A Pakistani man and an Indian woman might have very different ideas about the "line" which separates their "two political or geographical areas." A Kashmiri insurgent would likely disagree with them both, siting the "edge or boundary" of a space that neither the Pakistani man nor the Indian woman recognizes as legitimate. </p><p>A border dispute happens when two (or more) powers claim the same land. Sometimes, however, two powers really do have ownership over the same land. According to West's Encyclopedia of International Law, a condominium is "<i>a non-self-governing territory over which two states share administrative control.</i>" Other times, a single sovereign territory contains "exclaves"- pieces of land that are politically attached to a larger piece but not physically conterminous with it because of surrounding foreign territory (<i>Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language</i> 1989). </p>

    <p>Along the India-Bangladeshi border, there are 198 enclaves/exclaves. 92 are Indian exclaves, surrounded by Bangladesh, and 106 are Bangladeshi exclaves, surrounded by Indian territory (see Figure 1-2). There are 24 "second-order" exclaves, which sit within an enclave, and within the particularly complicated region of Cooch Behar, there is a third-order enclave: an enclave within an exclave within an enclave (Whyte, 2002). In many of the Indian exclaves, residents are dependent on Bangladeshi infrastructure, and the Bangladeshi Taka is used as the sole currency (R. Jones, 2009: 377). As Jones points out, "the existence of the enclaves undermines the claim of an unambiguous connection between a sovereign authority, a particular territory, and a single people," (377). There are hundreds more of these political exclaves/enclaves around the world.</p><p>Harder to define yet similar in nature to the existence of exclaves are embassies, military bases, special economic zones, even international airports. The legal and political regulations that govern sovereignty and rights in these spaces are often quite different from those in the surrounding area. If you ask someone to draw "The United States," you would most likely receive an image of the 48 contiguous states. But if we take into account the reality of overseas territories (as Bill Rankin has done in his map titled "The Territory of the United States: a patchwork of jurisdictions and rights", Figure 1-3), "The United States" looks quite a bit messier.</p>

    <p>Sometimes the "line" between two geographical areas is neither cleaved (as it is with enclaves) nor contested (as it is with disputed borders). Sometimes the line is just plain shifty. Tides move in and out on coastlines, changing the continental shapes our desk globes suggest. Polar ice caps are receding and expanding by the season despite their static white presence sandwiching our world maps. It is convenient to consider sovereignty in black-and-white terms, because then we can define "border" as the crisp line between one jurisdiction and another. But the truth is, sovereignty is a gray area, and "border" is a gray area, too. As Denis Wood preaches, "land isn't divided except in our heads and on our maps," (Wood, Fels, and  Krygier, 2010:49)</p>

    <h4>The Power of Maps</h4>
    
    <p style="text-align: center"><i>W=F*d</i></p>
    <p style="text-align: center"><i>Work=Force*distance</i></p>
    <p>Maps work. They help us get where we are going, they tell us what school district we are assigned to, they declare international boundaries that (most) people accept and respect. If you know the shape of Texas, you probably know it because of a map. Cartographer and scholar Timothy Stallmann explains that the question "How do maps work?" can be answered in two ways (2012: 11). The first way is psychological, concerning itself with how readers perceive and interpret maps. The second and perhaps more important way is concerned with the power of maps and their role in society. As Denis Wood reminds us, "work is the application of a force through a distance, and force is an action that one body exerts on another to change the state of motion of that body," (Wood, Fels, and Krygier, 2010:1). Indeed, maps don't only work, they <i>do</i> work. Maps have a powerful ability to persuade and propose. They are "engines that convert social energy into social space, social order, knowledge," (Wood, Fels, and Krygier, 2010:6).</p><p>Until the work of J.B. Harley in the 1980s, maps tended to be understood as records of geographic fact (Stallman, 2012). Harley was one of the first people to bring critical theory to the study and deconstruction of maps, encouraging others to think of maps not as mirror representations of 'the world', but as representations of the context and environment in which maps are produced. By reading "between the lines", Harley argued that the context of the map could be discovered, providing clues to what was included on the map as well as what was omitted (2001: 45). Building off of Harley's work, Denis Wood argues that maps are not only <i>not</i> <i>representations</i> of the world, but that they are in fact <i>propositions</i>. Wood explains that maps make their propositions through "postings," which are visual and linguistic claims that 'this is here,' (Wood, Fels, and Krygier, 2010).</p><p>In the introduction to the <i>Rethinking the Power of Maps</i>, Wood uses a Wake County school district map to illustrate power of maps. First, a map is needed to create- to propose- the existence of school districts. Before they are drawn, the districts literally don't exist! But who requires residents of Wake County to abide by the proposition of the districts? The map is backed up by the force of the school board, which is backed up by the law, which is backed up by the police and the military. While this logic might seem a bit extreme, Wood reminds us of when the National Guard had to enforce the rights of black students to attend integrated schools in the south.</p><p>Usually, however, the use of force to defend what is drawn on a map is not needed. This is because we tend to accept the communications of a map as fact, and arguing with reality doesn't seem worthwhile. To quote Wood, "The most fundamental cartographic claim is <i>to be a system of facts, </i>and its history has most often been written as the story of its ability to present those facts with ever increasing accuracy," (Wood and Fels, 1986: 63). In the past century, cartographers and scholars have constructed this fundamental cartographic claim through the professionalization of cartography (Wood, Fels, and Krygier, 2010:132). Ultimately, the attempt to separate Cartography (as an academic science) from the "handicraft" of map-making has been quite successful, thus further masking the indexical (or context-dependent) nature of maps (Turnbull and Watson, 1993). "Naturalizing" the map (i.e. defining it as a mere representation of the earth's surface) has universalized it and helped "obscure the map's origin in the rise of the state," (Wood, Fels, and Krygier, 2010:19).</p>

    <h4>The Rise of Nation-States and The Rise of Cartography</h4>
    
    <p>Another source of the map's power, hardly separable from it's propositional logic, is its ability to "give us a reality beyond our reach," (Wood, Fels, and Krygier, 2010:15). "Ultimately," says Wood, "the map presents us with the reality we <i>know</i> as differentiated from the reality we <i>see</i> and <i>hear</i> and <i>feel</i>," (Wood, Fels, and Krygier, 2010:16<i>).</i> Maps tell us what our country looks like and where we are within it. Maps are what tell us that a physical country exists at all! </p><p>Maps are so common in our daily lives that it is hard to imagine a time without them. Wood reminds us, however, that Genghis Khan, Charlemagne, the Roman emperors, and the pharaohs all ruled without maps, and that the Bible was written without ever referring to one (Wood, Fels, and Krygier, 2010:18). Wood's extensive research on the history of map making has shown that maps have really only been around since the sixteenth century. "People create maps only when their social relations call for them," says Wood, "and the social relations that most insistently call for maps are those of the modern state," (Wood, Fels, and Krygier, 2010: 19). Modern states require a territory to rule over, and maps provide them exactly that. </p><p>The common understanding of maps is that they simply abstract and represent things that already objectively exist, but Thongchai Winichakul's study of Siam (now Thailand) revealed a relationship that was entirely reversed. According to Thongchai, the map "was a model for, rather than a model of, what it purported to represent," (1994:310). Ultimately, Thongchai argues that the formation of Thailand as a modern nation-state would have been impossible without the map. Richard Helgerson claims a similar thing about Elizabethan England: that the cartographic representation of England had an ideological effect that strengthened national identity and loyalty (1992:144). The map's ability to construct the spaces that it eventually seems to merely represent is what Matt Sparke calls "the recursive proleptic effects of mapping," (1998:466).</p><p>Thongchai Winichakul (1994) has coined the term "geo-body" to describe the bounded spaces that maps construct. Geobodies, with their concrete edges, are controllable and ownable. They present themselves as "visually and territorially unified constructs," creating national unity between people who might otherwise be disjointed by geographic, political, or ideological distances, (Wood, Fels, and Krygier, 2010:31).</p><p>In sum, maps are not mirror representations of reality. Rather, as Wood eloquently puts it, "maps are an argument about existence," (Wood, Fels, and Krygier, 2010:34). Geobodies, and by extension borders, are created through mapping, which means that borders are nothing more than arguments about a particular space. Anyone can use a map to make an argument, but the arguments that become 'naturalized' as common sense in our society are the ones that come from those with the loudest voices, those with the most power. </p>

    <h4>Counter Cartography</h4>
    
    <p>In this thesis, I borrow Tim Stallman's use of the term "Western state cartography," to describe a type of cartography which purports to be objective and 'expert'; contains a state-ist and capitalist viewpoint which sees the Earth as a patchwork of bounded and ownable territorial units; and presents cartography as an empirical science (2012: 141).</p><p>Counter mapping (also called "counter cartography" or "critical cartography") has been questioning the hegemonic effects of Western state cartography for decades. In 1979 McArthur published his "Universal Corrective Map of the World" (Figure 1-4) to protest the prejudice for North-as-up orientation. His purpose is written plainly on the map: "Never again to suffer the perpetual onslaught of "downunder" jokes -- implications from Northern nations that the height of a country's prestige is determined by its equivalent spatial location on a conventional map of the world."</p>

        <img src="images/mcarthursmap.jpg">
    </div>
    
    <p>While McArthur literally turned cartographic convention on its head, others have employed strict cartographic norms to gain recognition for their counter-hegemonic causes. For example, since the early 1970s, indigenous mapping movements have questioned the control of the state and reclaimed titles to tribal lands using the same cartographic weapon that was used against them in the first place (Wood, Fels, and Krygier, 2010:147). As Bernard Nietschmann has said, "More indigenous territory has been claimed by maps than by guns. And more Indigenous territory can be reclaimed and defended by maps than by guns," (1995: 34). Indigenous counter-maps, for example, played a fundamental role in the creation of Nunavut out of Inuit land formerly considered part of British Colombia (Wood, Fels, and Krygier, 2010). In a map-obsessed society like our own, bounding historically unbounded territories is a precursor to them being recognized by the State. </p><p>Other counter cartographies are more concerned with exploring space and finding new ways to orient ourselves within it. As the Cartac collective writes, "Even though the map is not the territory, to make maps is to organize oneself, to generate new connections and to be able to transform the material and immaterial conditions in which we find ourselves immersed. It isn't the territory but it definitely produces territory," (,qtd. in Mendez de Andes et al. 157). Cobarrubias and Cortes point out that this idea resonates with Fredric Jameson's (1991) suggestion that we need a new sort of "global cognitive mapping" to reorient ourselves in a postmodern world (qtd. in Casas-Cortes and Cobarrubias 2007: 63). Other groups, such as Hakitectura (which I discuss later), have taken this idea even further, using cartography as a tool to actually create and enforce new physical spaces. </p><p>Counter cartography is a tool used by many different groups for vastly different causes, but intentionally or not, nearly all of them argue against the objectiveness of maps by demonstrating their subjectiveness. </p>

    <h4>Conclusion: Drawing and Interpreting Lines</h4>
    
    <p>Swedish Geographer Gunnar Olson once asked, "What is a geography if it is not the drawing and interpreting of a line?" In the introduction to <i>A History of Spaces, </i>John Pickles builds off of this question by asking, "What is the drawing of a line if it is not also the creating of new objects?" (Pickles, 2004: 3).</p>
    <p>Western state cartography, both influencing and influenced by the rise of nation-states, has drawn many lines and created many objects. Ultimately, it is responsible for our common understanding of "the border" as the line between two discrete sovereignties. This understanding is wrapped up in state-ist and capitalist viewpoint that sees the Earth as a patchwork of bounded and ownable territorial units (Stallman, 2012: 142). But maps and borders are contestable, and new ideas about the border are now being created and explored. A central part of this creation and exploration is redrawing the border on the map or even erasing it all together.  Building off of the knowledge that maps have the power to define "the border", Chapter Two will investigate a diverse array of cartographies and the equally diverse stories that they tell about where and what "the border" is. </b>
