<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<h1>SO THEN, WHAT <i>IS</i> "THE BORDER"?</h1>
<div id="4-1" class="section">
    
    <p>The conventional understanding of "the border" has been shaped by Western state cartography over the past several centuries. The rise of modern cartography and the development of the bounded nation-state are so closely intertwined, it is hard to say which phenomenon is more responsible for the other. Maps are powerful because they posture themselves as "representative" even though they are actually "productive." Using nothing but a thin ink line on paper, maps can, and have, invented borders that change lives and landscapes. Historically, maps have used their power to create and enforce a certain capitalist and state-ist perspective of the border as something that bounds land into fixed and ownable parcels. But cartography can also be used to present and produce new configurations of space and power, including the spaces and power of borders. </p>

    <p>New critical geographic studies of borders and migration are rethinking the dominant understanding of "the border" and what it means for flows of capital, ideas, and human lives. Western state cartography has framed "the border" as a wall, and although many critical geographers reject this interpretation, this understanding has produced a border spectacle with real physical impact on a place. Sometimes this impact is quite obvious, such as the installation of a fence, and other times it is less noticeable, such as the dead-end of a local road. Understanding "the border" as a "border regime" recognizes the actors, processes, and discourses that construct what looks like and acts as a "wall." These regime components include human migration, institutions of migration management, and sites and actors of conflict and resistance. An understanding of "the border" as a product of migration and migration management opens up new possibilities for the geographic location of the border. </p>
    
    <p>The externalization of border management practices and the decentralized impacts of those practices further modifies where we can claim "the border" physically exists. While the border can act as a wall of regulation and exclusion, some groups such as Hakitectura focus on the flows of capital, ideas, and culture that connect the spaces that others consider "divided" by "the border." The most progressive understanding of "the border" addressed in this paper accepts the border as a phenomenon composed of performance and experience. </p>
    
    <p>All of these new, multifaceted understandings of the border demand a new method of representation, and digital technology provides a modern and growing toolset with which to explore and visualize "the border." Interactive maps support the visualization of complex spatial and temporal components such as movement through space and time. Meanwhile dynamic maps allow users to explore and define landscapes via customization. But geographic visualizations in the digital age tend to look a lot like interactive versions of a static paper map, and they are equally as dependent on a Cartesian representation of space. Progressive understandings of "the border" as places of process and performance are not concerned with synthesizing a multitude of complex factors within a Cartesian space, but rather are concerned with transcending the Cartesian space all together. Limiting the visualization of these progressive viewpoints to a Cartesian map ultimately limits the viewpoints all together. These perspectives, therefore, demand methods of visualization that facilitate the exploration of space without tying it down to a Cartesian grid. While non-Cartesian spaces do not require digital visualization technologies, they can benefit from them. Most notably, interactive technology allows us to both gather and communicate more information at once.</p>
    
    <p>As a cartographer, my experimentation with new digital cartographic and visualization technologies has been radically informative. While I used to begin a project by determining on the best way to represent my subject in space,I now first question: <i>What is the real relationship between my subject and space?</i> I cannot help but imagine the academic and personal impact this relational understanding would have had on me if I had learned it in fifth grade instead of the state-ist and 'absolute' perspective that I was taught. I believe that unconventional and multifaceted representations of the border, which can be greatly aided by flexible and powerful digital toolsets, are the first step in overturning the simplistic and state-ist understanding of the border that has dominated for centuries. </p>
    
    <p>Our societal obsession with Scientific Truth makes us resistant to accept anything but a Cartesian coordinate pair as an answer to the question, <i>Where is the border</i>? This is an obstacle to unconventional- and in particular non-Cartesian- understandings of the border, but it is not an impossible hurdle. From Autism to sexuality to gender, things that were once considered discrete categories are increasingly considered spectrums. This progressive momentum gives me hope that borders, too, might someday be understood not simply as lines but as something with more dimensions. These dimensions might include history, performance, experience, power, conflict, as well as space. There are many dimensions to borders that I have left out, and even more that have not yet been discovered. From desert fences to global economies, borders have impact. The better we understand borders, the better we can understand the world around us. </p>
