<h1>MAPPING IT ALL OUT</h1>
<div id="0-1" class="section">
    <p>For centuries, borders have been thought of, and represented, as static, linear, and black-and-white, but recent studies and practices of critical cartography and geography are complicating this simplistic view. Just as cartography has been key in constructing this prevailing understanding of "the border", it can also challenge, disrupt, and supplant "the border." This thesis investigates how digital cartographic and visualization technologies can contribute to a new, more complex understanding of "the border."</p>

    <p>Before directly addressing this central question, it is important to explore what exactly the prevailing understanding of "the border" is and where this understanding came from. Chapter one identifies and problematizes the traditional explanation of the border as the line between two sovereign areas, and it traces the practice of bounding land back to the rise of the nation-state and the coterminous rise of Western state cartography. Chapter one also addresses why maps, by their propositional nature, are well positioned to create and enforce borders. </p>
    
    <p>Chapter Two then asks: Who/what is challenging the traditional understanding of the border, and where/how are these challenges being developed? It looks at a broad sample of cartographies that each approach and/or expose the border in different ways. The examples, which come from academics, activists, artists, and government institutions, serve as a survey of diverse border perspectives. Additionally, they provide glimpses into the different techniques and technologies that are being used to explore and expand the border. I do not argue that any particular understanding is better than the rest, but rather suggest that the border is made up of the culmination and co-occurrence of many understandings and the simultaneous spectacles that they produce.</p>
    
    <p>Chapter Three investigates how new cartographic and visualization technologies can help represent, produce, and explore a complex and multi-spectacled understanding of the border. </p>
    
    <p>Using my own work as examples, I present and evaluate the use of several digital technologies in border-related cartographies. Chapter three finds that interactivity, animation, customization, and multimedia integration make digital maps better suited than paper maps for the representation of multifaceted, multidimensional data. Additionally, the chapter confronts the assumption that spatial attributes necessarily have Cartesian locations, and it concludes that digital and paper cartographies alike should critically consider and accordingly represent the relationship between "the border" and Cartesian space.</p>
    
    <p>Borders are increasingly being understood as a complex phenomenon of performance, experience, movement, and conflict. While technology is not necessary for creating new understandings of "the border," it does support the sort of advanced and complex representations of space that new understandings of "the border" demand. I hope that this thesis can convince others to incorporate new visualization technologies into their attempts to overturn historical cartographic convention and redefine "the border" in meaningful ways.</p>
