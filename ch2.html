    <p style="text-align: center;"><i>"Land isn't divided except in our heads and on our maps." -Denis Wood</i></p>
    <p>Wood's quote intends to show that the division of land is artificial, but it also admits that the division is <i>real</i>. The power of maps is that they can <i>create</i> divisions- districts, territories, even borders- through their propositions. Borders, as manufactured as they may be, do exist, and they have real impact on politics, economics, societies, and individual lives. And if the map creates the border, then understanding the border is simply a matter of deciding what the map says about it. </p>

    <h4>Border As Wall</h4>
    
    <p>The rise of the nation-state required that land (as well as the people living on the land) be discretely bound, organized, and controlled. This produced a modern capitalist space that, Lefebvre (1991) explains, is "abstracted and organized as decorporealized, bureaucratized, and commodified," (Sparke, 1998: 464). The international political and economic climate at the turn of the century, emphasized by World War I, further necessitated the participation of discrete nation-states. State cartography (and the militant enforcement of that cartography) produced these bounded bodies and thus produced their borders. Rather, it could be said that it produced a <i>spectacle</i> of their borders. According to Casas-Cortes, et al., a border spectacle is a social relationship between people that is mediated by images (2014:12). Western state cartography has produced a spectacle of the border as a wall, whose primary social function is to divide, contain, and distinguish. Deeply intertwined with this border spectacle is the "us" versus "them" mentality.</p><p><br/></p>
    
    <p>For example, on Aschmann's Map of North American English Dialects (Figure 2-1), dialect isoglosses curve throughout the North American continent, paying no heed to state boundaries. But the region labeled as "Spanish speaking area" distinctly follows the US-Mexico border, as though the border was a sound- and culture-proof wall. This map, produced by a linguist with a relatively progressive agenda, is not an active attempt to shape the border as a wall, but it is an example of how this understanding of the border has influenced modern thought. It is also an example of how maps can, even inadvertently, enforce this understanding by unquestioningly bounding fluid social and cultural phenomenon within discrete political borders.</p><p>While many critical geographers will push back on the idea of the border as a wall (citing things such as the trans-border flow of capital, people, culture, etc.), the fact that it is so frequently drawn as such is evidence that many people really do understand it that way. And this understanding influences more than just thought: it can actually change the physical landscape of a place. Along the US-Mexico border, for instance, the physical construction of barriers has turned an imaginary line into a physical reality. As part of their "Borderland" project, National Public Radio partnered with the Center for Investigative Reporting to generate a map of all the fences along the US-Mexico border (Figure 2-2). This graphic uses an abstraction of space (a map) to illustrate the on-the-ground impact of the border, determined by user-contributed data from OpenStreetMap.org. The invisible border, made visible by the physical fence, determines where people can travel, the goods and services they have access to, the schools they can attend, and the legal rights that they hold.</p>

    <p>Bill Rankin has also mapped the physical impact of the US border, though his approach is less direct. His cartography titled "Thin White Line" (Figure 2-3) maps all of the roads on either side of the 49<sup>th</sup> parallel, which is the border between the US and Canada. At first glance, the image seems to be a chaotic cluster of thin gray lines. However on closer inspection, an absence of the tightly clustered gray lines creates a thin white line down the center of map. At exactly 49 degrees North, the white line is where the local roads on each side come to an end. Only a few major roads bridge the white gap, and even fewer are identified as legal border crossing stations. The illustration, though simple, effectively communicates one of the many tangible impacts of the border: the end of one local government's facilities and the beginning of another's. It also speaks to the control of movement across the border: geometry teaches us that a line is made up of infinite points, but only 54 of the points on this line are considered "legal" for intersecting. </p>

    <p>The idea of the border as a wall creates an image of the border, and thus the region it bounds, as established and unquestionable. The previous two examples illustrate this point by drawing attention to the physical, on-the-ground manifestations of the border: a gap in one case, a fence in the other. But while the impacts of borders are real and undisputable, exact location of borders are often disputed. International disputes such as that between India and Pakistan over Kashmir are easy to point to, but other disputes are much subtler. In another of Bill Rankin's projects called "The Midwests" (Figure 2-5), Rankin overlays 100 arguments about the boundary of the Midwestern region of the United States. We speak of "the Midwest" as though it is a discrete and obvious unit, but the cartography reveals that it is not as established or unquestionable as we often assume regions to be. In the map's caption, Rankin concludes that "The American Midwest has no obvious boundaries; it is, at best, a collection of ill-defined ideals about landscape, labor, and culture that vaguely invoke the westward march of U.S. expansion in the nineteenth century." The historopolitical context of the region's boundary(ies) and it's sloppy sociocultural associations are two characteristics relevant to not only this border, but nearly all borders. </p>

    <h4>Border Regime</h4>
    
    <p>The border as a "wall" is an idea created by Western state cartography, but it is enforced by a variety of actors, processes, and discourses. As Casas-Cortes, et al. point out, state agencies and policies "seek to invoke the border as a stable, controllable and manageable tool of selective or differential inclusion," (2014:15). Of course, these agencies would not have this job to do if it weren't for the "forces and movements of migration that challenge, cross, and reshape the border," (15). The <i>New Keywords</i> authors have used the term "border regime" to describe the multiple actors and movements which construct the border as a "site of constant encounter, tension, conflict, and contestation," (15). </p><p>A regime is much harder to visualize than a wall, but that has not stopped some groups from trying. MigMap (short for Migration Map) is an online, interactive visualization produced by an organization called Labor k3000 in collaboration with the Transit Migration project. It is a multilayered look at the complex processes, places, and actors involved in migration and the construction of the European border regime. According to transitmigration.org, MigMap does not "(re)produce territorial borders", but rather it "visualizes social space." This "social space" is where the conflict and negotiation of the border regime happen. </p><p>The MigMap project (Figure 2-6) includes four different visualizations: one maps out actors in migration, one maps out migration discourses, one maps out the phenomenon of Europeanization, and one maps out the places and processes of migration. The visualizations are not geographic maps of physical spaces, but rather each one maps out a component of the border regime which has constructed and enforced a divisive European border. The map of Europeanization, for example, looks like a subway transit map, but it is actually an interactive, multidimensional timeline of the meetings, conferences, papers, and processes that have constructed continental Europe as a discrete body. The map of Discourses looks like a topographic map, but it plots actors, campaigns, and terms and maps out migration discourses relative to non-Cartesian spaces (like neoliberal spaces and counter-hegemonic spaces). The map of Places and Practices quantifies spaces and institutions according to the things that they provide or require of migrants. The map contains personal stories embedded within it, introducing a hyperlocal component to the otherwise quantitative visualization. </p>

    <p>While MigMap visualizes the actors and processes <i>constructing</i> the European border, Transborder Map 2012 (Figure 2-7) maps out the people and forces working to <i>resist</i> this border. The map, produced by the noborder network, is a result of a transborder conference that took place in Istanbul in 2012. It aims to "document the multitude of actions against the European Border regime and includes key-incidents of struggles," (No Border Network, 2012). The map plots sites and actors of border resistance such as noborder camps, campaigns, local and international pro-migrant organizations, and migration routes. It also plots sites and actors of the border regime like detention centers, FRONTEX operations, and refoulements-expulsions of persons who have the right to be recognized as refugees. In resisting the border as a stable and exclusionary force, Transborder Map 2012 actually creates a new image of the border (or lack of border). In fact, the pro-migration and anti-border forces displayed on the map should be considered a border regime of their own. </p>

    <h4>No Border</h4>
    
    <p>Of course, while the "wall" might be a truth from some angles, it is a wild misunderstanding from other angles. Legally and illegally, people, cars, goods, capital, telecommunications, and music all traverse the border. Culture, language, and ideas mix and spread organically and abstractly, not according to any vector image on a political map. </p><p>Hakitectura is a group of critical architects, artists, and computer scientists who use cartography to create and redraw connected spaces. While the group engages with political issues across the globe, the majority of their work focuses on the militarized border between North Africa and Southern Europe. In a cartography called "Cartografia Critica Del Estrecho De Gibraltar" (Figure 2-8), Hackitectura refutes the 'border as wall' philosophy and constructs a counter understanding of the border as a complicated, contested, and connected space. </p>

    <p>Along the Straits of Gibraltar, the Spanish government draws the border as an impenetrable line on maps. But Hakitectura questions this impenetrability by mapping the paths of transborder communication and the globalization of capital and goods such as textiles. And just as the Spanish government enforces their interpretation of the border on-the-ground by controlling communication and flows across the border, Hakitectura enforces their own conception of the border space with a project called "Indymedia Estrecho." Borrowing methods used by hacker community, the project used free technology to subvert the power structures that regulate communication (Hakitectura, 2003). This action opened new links and lines of cross-border communication and constructed a temporary space of connections. </p>

    <h4>Border Externalization</h4>
    
    <p>Accepting that migration and migration management are key factors in a border-producing regime helps provide an answer to the question of <i>what</i> a border is, but it complicates the question of <i>where</i> the border is. While the US image of migration management often looks like walls and guards patrolling a line in the desert sand, the European image is quite different. As Casas, et al. point out, European migration management has recently shifted its focus from borderlines to migratory routes: programs such as EU Neighborhood Policies and the Migration Routes Initiative (under the framework of Global Approach to Migration) have essentially externalized migration management practices (2011:71-90). The <i>New Keywords</i> authors have included "border externalization" as an important term for modern border studies and have defined it as "the process of territorial and administrative expansion of a given state's migration and border policy to third countries," (19). </p>
    
    <p>The Interactive Map on Migration (Figure 2-9), or "i-Map", is an online interactive map produced by European border management agencies ICMPD, Europol, and Frontex. According to it's website, i-Map supports intergovernmental dialogues on migration by facilitating access to and exchange of information through visualizations and news. The project was developed as a way to educate policy makers and enforcement agencies about transit routes and points (Casas-Cortes, Cobarrubias, and Pickles, "Riding Routes and Itinerant Borders"). The map recognizes migration routes that span thousands of miles across multiple countries, and the project has refocused migration management efforts on these flows and networks rather than static lines. </p>
    
    <div class="figure">
        <p>Figure 2-9</p>

    </div>
    
    <p>As Casas-Cortes, Cobarrubias, and Pickles point out, "border externalization refers to a fundamental change in the scales and operations of border institutions," ("Riding Routes and Itinerant Borders": 1). The state practice of externalization, which claims the right to exert influence and control along migratory routes regardless of sovereign territorial limits, is actually <i>extending</i> and <i>altering</i> sovereignties (27). The externalization of migration management forces us to confront a type of sovereignty that is "not limited to the control of a closed territory (the Westphalian state model), but rather is concerned with the flows happening beyond territorial boundaries," (Casas-Cortes, Cobarrubias, and Pickles, "Good Neighbours Make Good Fences<i>"</i>: 2). </p>

    <p>Just as the control of migration (and thus the enforcement of borders) is not exclusive to the thin line of the political map's borders, neither is the effect of this control and enforcement. "Dying at the Gates of Europe" (Figure 2-10), though basic in design, shows the geographic expanse of the precarious impact of transborder migration. Drawn in 2003 by Olivier Clochard of the Migrinter Insititute at the University of Poitiers, the map has been updated and published for a segment about Europe's war on immigration by Le Monde Diplomatique, an independent international paper known for its critical vision (Rekacewicz, 2013). The hand-drawn map outlines the Schengen Area border in dark red, while the dots representing internment camps and migrant camps are scattered both within and outside of the delineated area. Graduated circles representing border-related deaths are located both on the Schengen border as well as within the region. The death and detainment depicted on the map is found across the entire continent, not just along the dark red line. </p>

    <p>Border externalization "changes the understanding of borders by reworking who, where, and how the border is practiced," (Casas-Cortes, et al. <i>New Keywords </i>19). I would add that it also changes how it is<i> experienced</i>. While the border of "Fortress Europe" is socially and culturally understood as a wall, border management practices reveal that the border is increasingly being treated as a complex network of routes, and that the impact of the border extends far beyond territorial boundaries. </p>

</div>
<div id="2-5" class="section">
    <h4>Border as Experienced/Performed</h4>
    
    <p>While counter mapping tends to replace or supplement the authority of the map, map art attempts to dissolve the authority of the map all together. As Denis Wood explains, map art "takes the statements, the assertions, the this-is-heres and the that-is-theres of the maps and says...really? Are you sure?" (Wood, Fels, and Krygier, 2010:270).</p><p>The Institute for Infinitely Small Things is an interdisciplinary group of artists and activists that "conducts creative, participatory research that aims to temporarily transform public spaces and instigate dialogue about democracy, spatial justice and everyday life," (Institute for Infinitely Small Things). They implement projects ranging from performance art to counter cartography. One project called "Erase the Border" (Figure 2-11) is particularly relevant to this study, as it questions the legitimacy of the US-Mexico border as it divides historic Tohono O'odham tribal lands. Through a digital platform, the project unifies each side of the border with videos, photos, maps, and the voices of the Tohono O'odham people. "The Border Crossed Us" (Figure 2-12) is an extension of this project in the form of a public art installation at the UMass Amherst campus. The project installed a to-scale photographic replica of the fence that cuts through Tohono O'odham land along the North-South boundary of the campus. Present for two weeks, the divider separated the two sides of campus and allowed passerbys to experience what it is like to have your community divided.</p>

    <p>Susan Page is an independent artist working on a project about the spaces and objects associated with migration across the US-Mexico border. "The US-Mexico Border Project" (see Figure 2-13) is a collection of photographs that document the mundane (yet personal and important) objects that are left behind as humans cross the border. The objects- which include toothbrushes, toys, socks, and water jugs- are photographed exactly as they are found, and they tell a story about the border as it relates to the act of migration and the people who attempt it. For Page, the border ceases to be a line or even a region, but rather it is a <i>site</i> of action and experience.</p>

    <p>Pedro Lasch is an artist who also works to tell a story about the border through migration experiences, but he takes a different approach than Page. For his project, "Latino/a America" (see Figure 2-14), Lasch provided prints of North and South America to people as they moved and traveled across the US-Mexico border. The prints were returned with rips, folds, dirt, and water stains, and are displayed as physical memoirs of the voyage between the two countries. The project does not attempt to draw or define the border; it focuses on the movement experiences of those who cross it. In some ways, "crossing" the border creates a line by acknowledging that it was traversed. On the other hand, the movement of people from place to place shows the openness and connections between the places, thus denying the border. </p>

    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    
    <p>At the beginning of this chapter, I oversimplified by claiming, "understanding the border is simply a matter of deciding what the map says about it." While it is true that the way we understand borders is influenced by the way borders are visualized, it is also true that the way we visualize borders is influenced by the way we understand them. Maps create borders, but humans create maps and humans are products of their contexts. </p>

    <p>For nearly two centuries, we have let "conventional cartography" define borders for us. But "conventional cartography" was created at a particular time with a particular purpose: to bound and organize territory for control by rising nation-states. Nowadays, our politics, economies, and societies are globalized, demanding that modern discourses be filled with diversities, multiplicities, movement, and evolution. This also demands a new type of mapping!</p>
    
    <p>Casas-Cortes and Cobarrubias illustrate that mapping is not simply a tool for explaining borders, but that is actually a useful and necessary tool for "understanding and navigating" them (2007: 65). Many border-minded groups and organizations are doing exactly that. Car-Tac Collective, for example, explains that their purpose is "to organize oneself, to generate new connections and to be able to transform the material and immaterial conditions in which we find ourselves immersed," (qtd. in Casas-Cortes and Cobarrubias 2007:64). In other words, this movement (like many others) recognizes that a border is more than a line, and they try to map it to make sense of it. </p>
    
    <p>Hakitectura, too, views cartography in a similar exploratory way: "as not knowing, as permanent research, as a survey of the composition of the social and the interstices of reality, a survey of social processes in conflict," (Monsell and Perez de Lama, 2006). The Interactive Map on Migration is another example of this cartographic exploration being done. By mapping international migration routes, i-Map revealed fluid and networked challenges to Fortress Europe, impacting the EU's approach to migration management and, therefore, impacting the border. </p>
    
    <p>The border is not a stable, static line, and this, Transit Migration explains, "necessitates the development of a new, adequate, dynamic method of description and representation," (Transit Migration, 2004). MigMap tackles this challenge using technology to represent the dynamic and multi-layered components of the border regime. NPR's Borderland project also attempts to use technology as a way to synthesize several border perspectives into a single multi-media composition. </p>
    
    <p>The attempt to synthesize multiple border spectacles is a significant one. As the <i>New Keywords</i> authors emphasize, it is the various forms of the border, their spectacles, and their unique representations which give rise to the public image of the border (14). Each of the visualizations mentioned above produces a new understanding of the border, how it functions, and what its effects are. Yet I am less interested in what each story is and more interested in the fact that multiple interpretations can, and do, exist. Rather than posing different understandings of the border as contradictory, a lot can be gained by placing them in conversation with one another. While each representation has faults and limitations, taken together they can provide a fuller and deeper understanding of the border phenomenon. <br/></p>
