    <p>This thesis came about as a means to two separate ends. First, I wanted a chance to explore a deeply rooted interest in borders. This interest began in fifth grade, where our social studies curriculum included world geography. I remember thinking that the division of countries was so arbitrary and I wondered if we couldn't simply redraw them or abolish them all together. This led to several arguments with my classmates who were much more willing to accept the natural existence of borders than I was, but my skepticism persisted. While I never quite accepted that borders <i>needed</i> to exist, I never thought to question what exactly "the border" was until my second semester as a Geography major.</p>

    <p>In the Fall of 2012, I attended a presentation about the political enclaves and exclaves along the Indian-Bangladeshi border. The existence of these small land-locked islands made me question everything I <i>thought</i> I knew about sovereignty, territory, and borders. Regardless of their necessity or natural existence, I had always assumed these sorts of geographic entities were clear-cut. Sovereignties suddenly became blurry, and the lines that once divided them ceased to exist. At least, they ceased to exist in the way I had always assumed. I undertook this thesis with the hope of using my theoretical education in geography to answer a few of my personal questions about borders.</p>
    
    <p>I also undertook this thesis with the hope of researching and applying new digital mapping practices. My interest in interactive mapping developed out of frustration with the limits of traditional and often outdated GIS practices, and a desire to expand my spatial analysis and data communication toolsets. For the past year I have immersed myself in the world of web design, coding, and open source data in order to gain the skills I need to begin making the sort of digital cartographies that I imagine. Practicing and perfecting new my own technological skills became an important part of this project, thus while I could have relied solely on the (more advanced) work of others to conduct my analyses, I chose to build own examples. While my visualization examples might not be technically perfect, my understanding of the technologies I discuss is much deeper now that I have tried them out myself. </p>
    
    <p>In addition to borders and visualization technology, my fascination with and coursework in linguistics has been an influencing factor in the direction of this paper. Linguistics has impacted the way I think about discrete categorization and meaning, both of which are relevant not only to language but also to the discussion of mapping and borders. Not only do maps use language, but they are a sort of language of their own. Denis Wood, a cartographer and scholar whose ideas have greatly influenced my work, also uses linguistic theories as a way to understand how maps make meaning and myth. As Wood explains, "Every map is at once a synthesis of signs and a sign in itself," (Wood and Fels, 1986:54).</p>
    
    <p>Looking back on the process of this thesis, I have accomplished both the theoretical and technological goals I set out to achieve, but in ways I had never predicted. I learned that all borders, not just the borders of political enclaves, are complex and contradictory. I also learned that technology is not necessarily as important as perspective when trying to generate and communicate new understandings. </p>
